Acknowledgement: Even though my trajectory generator works perfectly fine in norm conditions, my dijkstra seems to 
give wiggling path when z_resolution is much higher than xy_res, and thus causes my trajectory generator to 
fail the auto-grader. For this reason, I referenced my teamate Yuzhi Wang's dijkstra.m code, which was shared in our team google drive 
for the purpose of the lab.
